- `fillExampleData()`: Inserts sample financial data
- `saveSnapshot()`: Creates a timestamped copy
- `loadLastSnapshot()`: Restores the most recent snapshot
- `convertToMainCurrency()`: Updates exchange rates and calculations

## üìù Format Requirements

- Data rows: 10pt
- Group headers: Bold
- Subtotals: Italic
- Currency codes: Uppercase

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues and Limitations

### Structure Validation Issues

- Inconsistent validation of "Subtotal:" and "TOTAL:" entries - may incorrectly skip variations like "Subtotal" or "TOTA"
- Group structure validation needs improvement. Current structure requirements:
  ```
  Group Name
  - Subitem 1
  - Subitem 2 (Label)
  - Subitem 3
  Subtotal:
  ```
  The validator sometimes fails to properly check this hierarchy

### Planned Improvements

- Add automatic format correction for common structural issues
- Implement stricter group/subgroup relationship validation
- Enhanced subtotal detection and validation
- Smart case correction for standardized entries
